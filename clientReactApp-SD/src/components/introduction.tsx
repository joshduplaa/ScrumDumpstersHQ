      <h2>Hi, I'm Joshua Duplaa</h2>
      <p>Welcome to the nexus where engineering ingenuity meets analytical prowess. I'm a student at Texas Tech University in my final year of a double degree in Computer Science and Mathematics. 
            I build React applications, transform data into actionable insights and configure CI/CD Pipelines for automation and DevOps with a touch of cybersecurity flair. 
            Dive into to my projects and solutions as I work at the intersection of data science and software engineering.
